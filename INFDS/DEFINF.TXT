INFDS - README

USAGE
F (file) specification: add the keyword infds([ds_name])
D (data structure) specification: add a statement with open a definition 
 for a data structure with keyword "noopt".
 If you need more than one INFDS add the keyword "qualified".
 Then insert a statement with /COPY directive. You can use the member corresponding to file type:
  - database file: DEFINFF 
  - display file:  DEFINFD
  - printer file:  DEFINFP
Don't add "end-ds" at the end.

I suggest to create a short version with common fields useful in own environment.

ATTENTION!
 1) the subfield with integer data type are initialised at maximum value when out of context.
  4i 0 = 1077952576                                                                          
  2i 0 = 16448                                                                               
  2b 0 = 6448                                                                                
 2) The I/O count (read and write) are initialised after the first I/O operation (except open)
